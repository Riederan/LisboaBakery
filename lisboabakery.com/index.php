				<h2><b>“Best Portuguese Chicken in Town!!” </b> <small>
				No Portuguese Piri Piri Chicken recipe can be made without using Charcoal to grill the chicken. We have been grilling Piri Piri Chicken since we introduced
				Authentic Portuguese Churrasco Traditions to the Kitchener Waterloo and surrounding Area Since 2009! We grill our chickens in whole butterfly cut, 
				marinated for 48 hours in our mouth watering rich Portuguese Seasoning, so it takes time of the heat released by the charcoal and flavor of marinate to render 
				the fat and penetrate skin. All our chickens are halal certified for the extra healthy benefits. 
				We suggest you try our succulent BBQ Churrasco Chicken that is served with our famous house made Piri Piri Sauces mild or hot available. 
				All our foods are delicately prepared fresh daily from fresh ingredients. Taste and flour is what we strive for!</small></h2>
